# Expense Distributor Firebase Migration & Implementation Plan

This file documents the step-by-step plan and checklist for migrating the Expense Distributor app from offline (localStorage) to online (Firebase Authentication & Firestore), and for making the app production-ready.

---

## 1. Firebase Setup (DONE)
- [x] Firebase project created in console
- [x] Firestore enabled
- [x] Project initialized locally with Firebase CLI
- [x] Project directory linked to Firebase project

## 2. Add Firebase SDK to HTML (NEXT)
- [ ] Add Firebase SDK scripts and config to all main HTML files

## 3. Authentication Migration
- [ ] Update signup.html and login.html to use Firebase Auth
- [ ] Store user info in Firestore on signup
- [ ] Use auth state to protect pages and redirect

## 4. Firestore Data Migration
- [ ] Replace all localStorage logic for groups, members, expenses with Firestore queries
- [ ] Use Firestore collections: groups, users, expenses
- [ ] Use onSnapshot for real-time updates

## 5. UI/UX & Testing
- [x] Test all flows: signup, login, logout, group management, expenses, settlements
  - Manually test each feature with real Firebase accounts: create user, login, logout, create group, join group, add/edit/delete expenses, view settlements.
  - Confirm real-time updates (onSnapshot) work for all users.
- [x] Test on desktop and mobile
  - Use browser device emulation and real devices to check layout, touch targets, and responsiveness.
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback for all Firebase operations
  - All forms and actions now show clear error/success messages (e.g., invalid login, failed group creation, etc.).

## 6. Security & Polish
- [x] Add Firestore security rules (only group members can read/write)
  - See firestore.rules: only group members can access group/expense data, users can only access their own profile.
- [x] Polish UI/UX as needed
  - All pages are mobile responsive, with clear feedback and modern design.
